# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project created an easy-to-use tool assisting Steve in analyzing stock trends for his parents.
### Purpose
Steve’s parents began with DQ stock and need to further evaluate their portfolio. They chose DQ based on their love of ice cream but now want to take a step towards data driven investing.
## Results 

### Analysis  
The group of stocks in this data set varied greatly from 2017 to 2018 with the general positive trend to massive gains in 2017 and a general negative trend in 2018. ENPH and RUN both held significant positive gains both years. DQ overall gained but would have seen a decline in 2018 from 2017. 


## Summary
### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general
The main advantage of refactoring is efficiency. The code will run quicker than the original. The disadvantage of refactoring is the time it can potentially take. The benefits to time needed to refactor need to be evaluated. For example, if it takes you 30 minutes to refactor something that saves you 1 second and you run it less than 30 times the time savings doesn’t add up. 
### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
This script in particular had a significant time advance of 0.5-1 second in my experimentation. The advantage here is time saved for not a lot of effort as it was outlined in the assignment. However, as I am likely never to run this code on a continual basis and it functioned before the refactoring it may not have had enough of an advantage to outweigh my time.
